# Blocks

This are some blocks written in C because shell scripts are slow and cringe.
Most of this are ported from the slstatus modules.
I only ported the ones that I use, I will port the rest of the slstatus someday...

If anyone wants to create a separate repository for this files it's welcome to do so.

## Requirements

Xlib is required to bluid the keymap module, but if you are not gonna use that module you can remove it from the all rule in the makefile

## Licence
Like I said most of the code in this directory is actually from slstatus, so I will keep their Licence.
