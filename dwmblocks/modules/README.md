# Blocks

This are some blocks written in C because shell scripts are slow and cringe.
Most of this are ported from the slstatus modules.
I only ported the ones that I use, I will port the rest of the slstatus someday...

If anyone wants to create a separate repository for this files it's welcome to do so.

## CPU block

If you use it in dwmblock it will work but If you try to run it by itself it probably won't work.
This program needs to run in intervals, if you run it just one time it will not work. 

## Requirements

Xlib is required to bluid the keymap module, but if you are not gonna use that module you can remove it from the all rule in the makefile

## Licence
Like I said most of the code in this directory is actually from slstatus, so I will keep their Licence.
